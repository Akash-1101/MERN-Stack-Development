-> Maintaining a clean and efficient codebase is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.
-> Here are three coding best practices that contribute to achieving these goals:

Code Readability:

-> Use Descriptive Names: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Code should be self-explanatory, and readers should understand the purpose of each component without having to delve deeply into the implementation
-> Follow Consistent Formatting: Consistent indentation, spacing, and style contribute to code readability. Adopt a consistent coding style across the entire codebase. 
-> Comments for Clarity, Not Redundancy: Write comments to explain complex algorithms, decisions, or anything that might be unclear. Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code is doing.

Modularization and Single Responsibility:

-> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Aim to have functions and classes do one thing and do it well. A function or class should have a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

Effective Use of Version Control:

-> Use Meaningful Commit Messages: Write clear and meaningful commit messages. Each commit should represent a logical change, and the commit message should describe the purpose of the change.
