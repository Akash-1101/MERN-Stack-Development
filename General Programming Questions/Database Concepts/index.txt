SQL Databases:

1.SQL databases are based on a structured and predefined schema, often to a rigid table-based structure.
2.SQL databases are relational and use tables to organize and store data. Relationships between tables are established using keys.
3.SQL databases adhere to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring transactional consistency.

Examples:

MySQL: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for web applications.
PostgreSQL: Another powerful open-source RDBMS known for its extensibility and support for advanced data types.
Oracle Database: A commercial RDBMS with a long history, used for enterprise-level applications.

Use Cases:

Applications with complex queries and transactions.
Systems where data integrity is critical, such as financial applications.

NoSQL Databases:

NoSQL databases are schema-less, allowing for more flexibility in the types and structures of data that can be stored.
NoSQL databases do not follow a strict relational model, and data can be stored in various formats, including key-value pairs, documents, column-family, or graphs.
NoSQL databases follow the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent), emphasizing availability and performance over strict consistency.

Examples:

MongoDB: A document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like BSON documents.
Cassandra: A distributed NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data across multiple commodity servers.
Redis: A key-value store often used for caching and real-time analytics.

Use Cases:

Big data and real-time applications requiring horizontal scalability.
Situations where the data structure is evolving and may change frequently.

Summary:
SQL databases are well-suited for applications with complex relationships, structured data, and a need for ACID properties.
NoSQL databases provide more flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data and are suitable for distributed and horizontally scalable systems.
